# Tab Example with Loader

This is a simple HTML file demonstrating the use of tabs with a loader for form submission.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

## Dependencies

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Usage

1. Include the necessary dependencies using CDN links in the `<head>` section.
2. Customize the loader animation and form content as needed.
3. Update the form submission URL in the JavaScript section (`submit_form.php` is a placeholder).

## Loader Animation

The loader uses a pulsating dot animation while submitting the form. You can customize the loader styles in the CSS section.

## Tabs

Tabs are implemented using Bootstrap's `nav` and `tab-content` components. Modify the tab names, content, and form fields based on your requirements.

## Form Submission

The form submission is handled asynchronously using jQuery AJAX. Update the form submission URL and adjust the success/error handling as needed.

```html
<!-- Example of form submission script -->
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#form1").submit(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            // Show loader
            $("#loader").show();
            $.ajax({
                type: "POST",
                url: "submit_form.php", // Update this URL
                data: $(this).serialize(),
                success: function(response) {
                    var response = $.parseJSON(response);
                    // Hide loader on success
                    $("#loader").hide();
                    // Handle the response
                    if (response.success) {
                        // Switch to the next tab with animation
                        $('#myTabs a[href="#content2"]').tab('show');
                    } else {
                        alert("Verification failed. Please try again.");
                    }
                },
                error: function(error) {
                    console.error("Error submitting form: ", error);
                    // Hide loader on error
                    $("#loader").hide();
                    alert("An error occurred. Please try again later.");
                },
            });
        });
    });
</script>

Copy and paste this into your GitHub README.md file, and adjust the content as needed.
## Folder Structure

- css/: Contains external stylesheets.
- js/: Includes external JavaScript files.
- submit_form.php: Placeholder PHP file for handling form submissions. Update this based on your server-side logic.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to fit your project requirements. Here are a few areas you might want to modify:

- Update the form fields and validation in `content1` tab as per your application needs.
- Adjust the loader animation styles in the CSS section to match your project's design.
- Customize the form submission URL and handling in the JavaScript section (`submit_form.php`).
