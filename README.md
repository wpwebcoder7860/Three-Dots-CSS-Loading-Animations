# Tab Example with Loader

This is a simple HTML file demonstrating the use of tabs with a loader for form submission.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

## Dependencies

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Usage

1. Include the necessary dependencies using CDN links in the `<head>` section.
2. Customize the loader animation and form content as needed.
3. Update the form submission URL in the JavaScript section (`submit_form.php` is a placeholder).

## Loader Animation

The loader uses a pulsating dot animation while submitting the form. You can customize the loader styles in the CSS section.

## Tabs

Tabs are implemented using Bootstrap's `nav` and `tab-content` components. Modify the tab names, content, and form fields based on your requirements.

## Form Submission

The form submission is handled asynchronously using jQuery AJAX. Update the form submission URL and adjust the success/error handling as needed.
Copy and paste this into your GitHub README.md file, and adjust the content as needed.
## Folder Structure

- css/: Contains external stylesheets.
- js/: Includes external JavaScript files.
- submit_form.php: Placeholder PHP file for handling form submissions. Update this based on your server-side logic.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to fit your project requirements. Here are a few areas you might want to modify:

- Update the form fields and validation in `content1` tab as per your application needs.
- Adjust the loader animation styles in the CSS section to match your project's design.
- Customize the form submission URL and handling in the JavaScript section (`submit_form.php`).
